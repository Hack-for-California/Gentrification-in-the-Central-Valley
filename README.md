# Gentrification-in-the-Central-Valley

## About 
This project works collaboratively with the Center for Regional Change on an Urban Displacement Project. Our purpose is to exmamine gentrification in the Central Valley specifically countries that are vulnerable to gentrification and displacements especially as more Bay area residents move into the county and either commute to work (outside of the county) or work remotely. This research mimicks an existing projects code (linked below) and modiefies it to the regions of interest (areas of interest include San Francisco 2018 data/map, normalized Sna Joaquin County (county code 077)).
