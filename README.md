# Gentrification-in-the-Central-Valley

## About 
This project works collaboratively with the Center for Regional Change on an Urban Displacement Project. Our purpose is to exmamine gentrification in the Central Valley specifically countries that are vulnerable to gentrification and displacements especially as more Bay area residents move into the county and either commute to work (outside of the county) or work remotely. This research mimicks an existing projects code (linked below) and modiefies it to the regions of interest (areas of interest include San Francisco 2018 data/map, normalized Sna Joaquin County (county code 077)).

## Data Collection and Update Process

External datasets were provided by the Center for Regional Change. The rest of the data is obtained from the American Community Survey (ACS) on the US Census Bureau site. This study uses 2014-2018 5-yr data summarized at the census tract level. Census tracts are areas whose boundaries typically remain consistent over time, with an average population of 4,000 people. Therefore, tracts in urban areas are smaller compared to those in rural areas.
